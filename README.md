# apod-view.widget
Übersicht APOD desktop picture

This widget requires the GD library and Perl to be installed. 
It accesses the http://apod.nasa.gov/apod website and grabs the current picture of the day.
This is downloaded and resized and placed in as your wallpaper. If it is a video it uses a default image instead.

Configuration

Two lines in the apod.pl script will need changing to suit your screen dimensions.
The refresh rate is set in the index.coffee script. It is set to refresh twice a day. 

Disclaimer

I have no idea what I'm doing. Use this at your own risk. I wrote it for myself. 
Change it as you wish but please share the improvements with me:

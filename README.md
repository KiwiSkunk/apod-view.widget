# apod-view.widget
Ãœbersicht APOD desktop picture
This widget requires the GD library and Perl to be installed. 
It accesses the http://apod.nasa.gov/apod website and grabs the current picture of the day.
This is downloaded and resized and placed in as your wallpaper.

Configuration
Two lines in the apod.pl script will need changing to suit your screen dimensions.
It is set to refresh once a day. This is set in the index.coffee script.

Disclaimer
I have no idea what I'm doing. Use this at your own risk. I wrote it for myself. 
Change it as you wish but share the improvements with me:
